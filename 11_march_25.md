Today, I started the "OOP with JavaScript" section, where I learned the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and how it is implemented in JavaScript.
I revised constructor functions, which allow us to create multiple objects with the same structure and behavior. Then, I learned about prototypes, which enable objects to inherit properties and methods, making JavaScript more efficient. I also studied ES6 classes, which provide a cleaner and more structured way to create objects and implement inheritance. Additionally, I covered static methods, which are defined on a class itself rather than instances, and Object.create, which allows us to create objects directly from a prototype without using constructors or classes.
