Today, I continued learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript, focusing on inheritance between classes. I explored different ways to implement inheritance using ES6 classes, constructor functions, and Object.create. These techniques allow one class to inherit properties and methods from another, making the code more reusable and organized.
 also learned about encapsulation, which helps restrict direct access to certain properties and methods, improving data security and code structure. Additionally, I explored method chaining, which allows multiple methods to be used in a single line, making the code more readable and efficient.

 After this, I started working on the "Mapty" app project, which uses the Geolocation API and the Leaflet library to display maps.
