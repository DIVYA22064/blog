Today, I continued working on the Mapty app, which I started yesterday.I worked on displaying map markers and input forms, allowing users to mark locations on the map. I also planned and implemented the project architecture, organizing the code properly by creating classes to manage workout data efficiently. Additionally, I learned how to move markers when selecting a workout, making the map more interactive. Lastly, I worked on saving data using local storage, so users' workout details remain available even after refreshing the page.
