Today, I started learning about Asynchronous JavaScript, which helps in handling tasks that take time, like fetching data from a server.
I began with AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and APIs.I made my first AJAX call to fetch data from an API, understanding how web applications communicate with servers. Then, I learned about Promises and the Fetch API, which provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous tasks. I also explored chaining promises, which ensures multiple asynchronous operations execute in order. Finally, I studied the event loop, which is responsible for managing JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous behavior and handling tasks efficiently in the background.
