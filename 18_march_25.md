Today, I started learning about Modern JavaScript Development, which focuses on organizing and optimizing code for real-world applications.

I began with ES6 modules, where I learned how to import and export functions and variables between different JavaScript files. This helps in writing cleaner, modular, and more maintainable code. I also explored top-level await, which allows using await directly in modules without wrapping it inside an async function, making asynchronous code easier to manage.

After that, I started learning about NPM (Node Package Manager), which is used to install and manage external JavaScript libraries. I also learned about bundling with Parcel, a tool that optimizes JavaScript files by combining them into a single, efficient file for faster performance.
