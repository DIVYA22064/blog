Today, I revised the basics of HTML and CSS. I went through topics like:

HTML: Attributes, classes, and IDs, which help in structuring and identifying elements.

CSS: Styling elements using selectors and understanding the box model, which controls the spacing and layout of elements.

After that, I started learning about the DOM (Document Object Model) and how to manipulate web pages using JavaScript.Along with learning about the DOM, in this section, we created three small projects: Guess My Number, Modal Window, and Pig Game.
