Today, I started the "Working with Arrays" section, beginning with the basics of arrays and how to loop through them efficiently.
After that, I started working on the "Bankist" app project, where I created DOM elements dynamically using JavaScript. I also learned about data transformation methods like map, filter, and reduce in detail. 
These methods help modify and process arrays efficientlyâ€”map creates a new array by applying a function to each element, filter extracts specific elements based on a condition, and reduce combines elements into a single value.
Further, I learned about chaining methods, which allows multiple array methods to be used in a single line for cleaner and find method.
